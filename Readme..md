# Typing-Test

**Typing-Test** is a web-based application designed to help users measure and improve their typing speed and accuracy. The app presents users with a random paragraph and tracks their performance as they type, providing instant feedback on mistakes and calculating words per minute (WPM).

## How It Works

- **Choose a Time Limit:**  
  Users can select from three different test durations: 15 seconds, 30 seconds, or 60 seconds.

- **Start Typing:**  
  A random paragraph is displayed. As the user types in the input box, each character is checked in real-time. Correct letters are highlighted, while mistakes are marked in a different color.

- **Live Feedback:**  
  The app keeps track of the number of mistakes and visually indicates which character the user should type next by blinking.

- **Results:**  
  When the timer runs out, the app displays the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM), the number of characters typed, and the number of mistakes made.

- **Redo Option:**  
  Users can easily restart the test at any time to try and improve their score.

## Purpose

Typing-Test is ideal for anyone looking to practice and enhance their typing skills, whether for personal improvement or just for fun. The instant feedback and simple interface make it accessible for typists of all levels.
